                <h2>Dear University of Melbourne CS department,</h2>

                <p>As postgraduate students and graduates of the University of Melbourne Computer Science programs, we write to express our profound concern about the declining quality and breadth of the CS curriculum. Our experiences—both in the job market and when comparing our education to peer institutions—have revealed significant gaps that undermine the value of a UniMelb CS degree.</p>

                <h3>Critical Gap: Missing Fundamental Courses</h3>
                <p>The University of Melbourne has systematically removed core computer science courses that are considered <em>essential</em> at every reputable CS program worldwide. These discontinued courses include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Programming Language Implementation (COMP90045)</strong> - Compilers and interpreters</li>
                    <li><strong>Program Analysis and Transformation (COMP90053)</strong> - Static analysis and optimization</li>
                    <li><strong>Constraint Programming (COMP90046)</strong> - Constraint satisfaction and reasoning</li>
                    <li><strong>Programming the Machine (COMP20006)</strong> - Low-level systems programming</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The result is stark:</strong> UniMelb now offers <em>zero</em> dedicated courses in compilers, operating systems design, or advanced systems programming at the postgraduate level. The sole systems course, Computer Systems (COMP30023), is not available to Master of Information Technology or Master of Computer Science students—the very programs marketed to career-changers who most need this foundational knowledge.</p>

                <p>This is not a minor curricular adjustment—it represents a fundamental abandonment of core computer science education. Students are graduating without understanding how programming languages work, how operating systems manage resources, or how to optimize code performance.</p>

                <h3>Documented Impact on Graduate Outcomes</h3>
                <p>The consequences of these gaps are not theoretical. Graduates consistently report being disadvantaged in technical interviews and on-the-job performance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Industry feedback:</strong> Employers note UniMelb CS graduates lack fundamental systems knowledge compared to peers from other universities</li>
                    <li><strong>Interview struggles:</strong> Students report failing technical interviews due to gaps in operating systems, compilers, and low-level programming concepts</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-directed learning burden:</strong> Graduates are forced to self-study core CS concepts that should be covered in their degree</li>
                    <li><strong>Research limitations:</strong> PhD applicants face disadvantages when applying to top programs due to missing foundational coursework</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Declining Quality of Existing Courses</h3>
                <p>Beyond the missing courses, the quality of remaining subjects has deteriorated significantly. Current offerings fail to meet industry standards and lack intellectual rigor:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Internet Technologies (COMP90007)</strong> exemplifies this decline. Despite being positioned as a comprehensive networking course, students report:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assessments limited to basic tasks like using the `ping` command</li>
                    <li>No coverage of modern networking protocols, network security, or distributed systems architecture</li>
                    <li>Content that would be considered introductory at most universities</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Distributed Systems (COMP90015)</strong> suffers from similar issues:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Curriculum unchanged for over a decade, focusing on obsolete technologies</li>
                    <li>Emphasis on basic Java socket programming rather than modern distributed computing paradigms</li>
                    <li>No coverage of cloud computing, microservices, or distributed consensus algorithms that define the modern field</li>
                    <li>Students consistently report it feels like "Java Sockets 101" rather than a graduate-level distributed systems course</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Stark International Comparison</h3>
                <p>The inadequacy of UniMelb's CS program becomes undeniable when compared to international standards. Students who participate in exchange programs consistently report a jarring difference in academic rigor and breadth:</p>

                <p><strong>Exchange experiences reveal the gap:</strong> At top international universities, students in single-semester courses are expected to build complete operating systems, implement production-quality compilers, and contribute bug fixes to real-world systems like GCC and Clang. Meanwhile, UniMelb students struggle to find courses that even <em>introduce</em> these concepts.</p>

                <p><strong>The exchange dependency problem:</strong> Many students now view international exchange as essential to obtaining a quality CS education—a damning indictment of the local program. This creates a two-tiered system where only students with the financial means and visa eligibility to study abroad receive adequate CS training.</p>
